Open PGL API
============

The API specification of Open PGL is currently still in a "work in progress" and might change with the next releases - depending on the community feedback and library evolution.  

We therefore only give here a small overview of the C++ class structures and refer to the individual class header files for detailed information.

------
```C++
#include <openpgl/cpp/Device.h>
```


Field
-----
```C++
#include <openpgl/cpp/Field.h>
```


SurfaceSamplingDistriubtion
---------------------------
```C++
#include <openpgl/cpp/SurfaceSamplingDistriubtion.h>
```

VolumeSamplingDistriubtion
--------------------------
```C++
#include <openpgl/cpp/VolumeSamplingDistriubtion.h>
```

SampleData
----------
```C++
